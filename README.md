Zomato Data Analysis
This is my first project, where I analyze Zomato’s restaurant data to uncover key insights.
📊 Key Insights:
1️⃣ Zomato's Huge Reach
Covers 7,086 restaurants in 15 countries and 139 cities—a truly global presence! 🌍
2️⃣ People Are Engaged!
2 million votes show that customers actively rate and review restaurants.
Most restaurants are rated as Very Good, Good, or Excellent, meaning people generally have a good experience.
3️⃣ Where Are Most Restaurants?
New Delhi has the most listed restaurants, followed by Noida and Gurgaon.
The world map shows restaurant distribution across different regions.
4️⃣ What’s on the Menu? 🍕🍜
North Indian, Chinese, and Fast Food are the top cuisines.
The variety is huge—Pizza, Bakery, and Café options are also widely available.
5️⃣ How Much Do People Spend? 💰
Some places have high-end dining with an average cost for two reaching 800K!
6️⃣ What Can We Filter?
Check restaurants based on:
 ✅ Online delivery availability
 ✅ Country name
 ✅ Whether the restaurant is delivering now
7️⃣ Dashboard Navigation is Smooth 🎯
Home, Refresh, and Info buttons make it easy to explore the data.
💡 Why This Matters?
✔️ Customers love engaging with ratings and reviews.
 ✔️ Many restaurants don’t offer online delivery—a big opportunity to grow! 🚀
 ✔️ The market is competitive in big cities like Delhi, but smaller cities could be growth areas.
